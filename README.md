# AST 203: Astronomy Final Project
AST 203: Final Project Topic

This project focuses on stimulating a star cluster to explore violent relaxation, a process in which the orbits of individual stars change dramatically due to shifts in the system's gravitational potential, helping the system settle into a more stable, balanced state. When run in Jupyter Notebooks, the project will provide an interactive platform to simulate and visualize how star clusters evolve under their own gravity, focusing on how changes in their positions, velocities, and interactions shape their dynamics.
